So there are going to be actually a lot of engines.


Income, and this will have nested income for each income type
Expenses, and this will have nested expenses for each expense type

Guard conditions: 
Are you even likely to be eligable. This could be worked out first, and is 'maybe/no' as a result

Residency 
is used if 107a and 108a. There is a bit of time reasoning etc. It would be nice to abstract that into an engine

Overlapping Benefits
Sounds like quite a few cases here, and that time is relevant. Would be nice to have a load of tests for it

Does a date range cover the week specified by a date?
i.e. if any part of the carebreak is in a week, that week is trashed (seems harsh...)





Learning
I want a good caching story
I want to be able to work with a cache that's passed in: Lens will do that.
