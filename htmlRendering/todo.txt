From Carers
* Assertions
* CDDJunit package name... is it a big deal?
* Cached
* TraceItem print/html


Quality of life
* Improve the toString of the matchOn
* allow because to have a partial function to boolean (and ensure that has a nice toString)


Go to Carers and some of the others, and make sure they work 
(expecting issues with titles / descriptions and stuff)
