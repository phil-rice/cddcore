We want to get rid of if then printer
* So that I can use the path to get the urls...
* And also because it's a second Mechanism

Then Add urls!

Deal with usecases/etc with same name as another... 

Adjust the Printer class so that I register 'if you see this requirement, do this...'

That simplifies inheritance (prefer composition) while also allowing me to easily specify stuff.
