I'm proposing you pick who I share the room / apartment with. I can make some people if you want however.

Natasha is in room 23C of the Acorn Hall of Residence. Acorn comprises of the top 4 stories of an entire block. The ground floor is populated by shops mostly targeting students: Coffee shops, cheap supermarkets and more kebab and pizza shops that you can shake a stick at.

The C in the room designation tells you which floor the apartment is on. A is just above the shops, and D is the top floor. 23C is a corner apartment sitting over above a Costa Coffee store. Most of the apartments have a small balcony that allows the occupants to sit out and watch the street below and 23 C is no exception. The apartments are grouped into units of four. Each cell has a large kitchen with a table, shared toilet facilities and a small living room. With up to eight people sharing, it can get quite crowded at times.

Inside the room are two desks and two single beds, and two wardrobes. A single sink sits in the corner. The rooms are well appointed: a tribute to the refurbishment that took place three years ago. The floors are wood laminate and the walls are paint onto clean plasterboard.

Overall it's a very pleasant Hall of Residence, refurbished to attract the upper market student: those that aiming for lucrative degrees including Law.

Natasha has only a few personal touchs: A photograph of a man and woman holding a child bearing a vague resemblance to herself and a stress ball. Her locked suitcase is on the floor of the well stocked wardrobe.
