Short Term
==========

Sort out the CDD website so that it points to the Wiki

Ensure the examples look really good 

XML situation print out

Decision tree slightly nicer

Usecase command should do title and description at the same time.. probably for the scenario as well

We need a more flexible requirement structure.
   Look at the Tennis scorer for an example. Under the 'Wins if...' it would be nice to group the left won and the right won.
   Plus if we don't want a use case, we shouldn't need one
   
   
Have a live website serving up the code. This would allow AutoTdd to sort itself out


Medium term

Consider
========
I want to be able to use partial functions with bindings:
   case x: X => "is OK"  as the combination because and code.
   I think this is a precursor to effective multiple trues
