Short Term
==========

We need a more flexible requirement structure.
   Look at the Tennis scorer for an example. Under the 'Wins if...' it would be nice to group the left won and the right won.

BJSS getting started
* Scaladoc => Javadoc as part of up load
  
Our ideas
* PersonUnit
   
BUGS: 
* Usecase references not visible 
* Minor tweak to live website: try website has a link. the decision view on live is lying

From the Blackpool trial
Bug
Is it a feature, is it a bug?
* The 'undecided exception' should include information about the scenario, and which engine it is in. It's quite hard to debug when an engine calls another engine


Features
* Allow more variables to be added to the XmlSituation. Perhaps using an annotation
* The JsonSituation would be very simple and very useful.

Completed
Bugs 
* The caching engine cannot be Junit tested  
* the 'redundant becauses' bug 
* The 'default code' is not being used for engines/childengines. Exact recreation unknown yet. Work around is to have that code on the first scenario
* Junit names need to be unique

Not doing
* Engines that are 'defs' instead of 'vars' should throw an exception if there isn't an annotation stopping it. In most scenarios I am aware of this would be a defect
              ---> So I had a look at this, and through Java Reflection I couldn't see how to spot the difference between a val and a def


Medium term
==========





Consider
========
I want to be able to use partial functions with bindings:
   case x: X => "is OK"  as the combination because and code.
   I think this is a precursor to effective multiple trues 
  

Done
Sort out the CDD website so that it points to the Wiki
Have a live website serving up the code. This would allow AutoTdd to sort itself out
Ensure we deal with titles - duplicates, too long... etc
Ensure the examples look really good 
XML situation print out
Decision tree slightly nicer
Usecase command should do title and description at the same time.. probably for the scenario as well
Document driven view of the website
Nested Engines
If we don't want a use case, we shouldn't need one
